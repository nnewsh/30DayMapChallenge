## European Population Decline ##

This figure is from a forthcoming publication that sets out to describe a typology of population decline pathways in regional Europe. 

Sequence and cluster analysis techniques were employed to collectively analyse population change trajectories of 1,871 sub-national areas across 43 European territories. Using Eurostat and national statistics annual population count data (2000-2018), the analysis finds that such trajectories can be grouped into eight distinct clusters, each describing nuances relating to the pace, timing and extent of popualation decline. The clusters describe trajectories of accelerating, diminishing, temporary and stable decline. 

This map illustrates the geographic distribution of the eight distinct population decline trajectory clusters across regional Europe.
