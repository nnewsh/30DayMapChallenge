## European Population Decline ##

This figure is from a forthcoming publication that describes a typology of population decline trajectories in regional Europe. Sequence and cluster analysis techniques were employed to collectively analyse population change trajectories of 1,871 sub-national areas across 43 European territories. Using Eurostat and national statistics annual population count data (2000-2018), the analysis finds that trajectories of population decline can be grouped into eight distinct clusters, each describing nuances relating to the pace, timing and extent of decline. The clusters describe trajectories of accelerating, diminishing, temporary and stable declines. 

This map illustrates the geographic distribution of the eight distinct population decline trajectory clusters across regional Europe.
